<h1>eXpeditions</h1>

In addition to vetted project guidelines, this repo also contains the findings of PD time to preserve and radiate the knowledge Excellians have gleaned from their professional development.

While these findings have not undergone the same scrutiny as the outcomes from JavaScript Death Battlesâ„¢, they are valuable as they are varied.

To add the outcome of your own eXpedition, please do the following:
- make a new branch 
- create a seperate ".md" file in this directory to record your findings (using this template)
- link to it in this file using the established format for your link / info in the table of contents below: 
- celebrate your contribution~ (you have bettered the Excella dev community and looked great doing it :) )
